# r-workshop
My activities from the R Programming Language for Beginners are in this repository. Created 21/04/2025.
I joined a workshop activity hosted in my university Gaziantep Üniversitesi, Gaziantep, Türkiye. Date and time: 21.04.2025, 10.00 AM - 12.30 PM. Place: Eğitim Fakültesi A Blok, AMFI. Instructor was an amazing person, her name is Dr. Justyna MacKiewicz, a linguist and mathematician who taught us some basics of the R programming language so that my faculty can make the switch from SPSS programming language to R programming language for the ease of use and FOSS capabilities in the educational research fields. I have done some independent studying of my own, mainly learning from the 2-hour course of FreeCodeCamp and using their course files to test the capabilities of the R language and the RStudio IDE. I will not be posting FreeCodeCamp's course files, however I will be posting the messy files I've made myself.
